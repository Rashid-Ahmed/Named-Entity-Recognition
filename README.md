# Named Entity Recognition 

This is a Github repository to train Named Entity Recognition models. 

## Usage

## Model

I used the DeBERTa v3 large model. Refer to ner/config.py file for further hyperparameters.

## Dataset

The NER model is trained on the few-nerd dataset from DFKI. The repository could be used with any NER dataset with small changes.
The Token labels are Person, Organisation, Location, Building, Event, Product, Art & Misc.
